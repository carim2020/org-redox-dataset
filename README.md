# org-redox-dataset

We try to build a novel molecular database that contains small organic redox-active molecules which can be used for multiple purposes, one of them being the construction of novel ion-metal battery electrodes. We use qunatum chemistry methods to optimize the molecular geometries we provide here. We hope our data will be useful for other researchers in the field.
