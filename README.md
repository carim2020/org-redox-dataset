# org-redox-dataset

A molecular database that contains small organic redox-active molecules which can be used for multiple purposes, one of them being the construction of novel ion-metal battery electrodes. We use qunatum chemistry methods to optimize the molecular geometries. We hope our data will be useful for other researchers in the field.

# Repository Content

* **molecule_geometries** - this directory contains the B3LYP-optimized geometries the reducible and Li-reduced molecules in XYZ format 
* **datasets** - this directory contains the descriptor values and the corresponding redox potentials for entire dataset, the training and the test set.
* **Models.ipynb** - a jupyter notebook that demostrates how to build different machine learning models using the dataset created.
