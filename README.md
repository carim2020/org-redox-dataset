# org-redox-dataset

We try to build a novel molecular database that contains small organic redox-active molecules which can be used for multiple purposes, one of them being the construction of novel ion-metal battery electrodes. We use qunatum chemistry methods to optimize the molecular geometries we provide here. We hope our data will be useful for other researchers in the field.

# Content

The repository contains:

* **reducible_molecules_geom** - this directory contains the B3LYP-optimized geometries of the reducible molecules in XYZ format 
* **Li_reduced_molecules_geom** - this directory contains the B3LYP-optimized geometries of the Li-reduced molecules in XYZ format
* **Table.xlsx** - an Excel table which contains 2D graphical representations, PubChem CIDs and stadard electrode potential values for all molecules in the dataset  

# Computational protocol

_The Gaussian 16 (G16) program was used at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory._
